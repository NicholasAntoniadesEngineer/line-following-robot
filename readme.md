# STM32 Line Following Car

This repository contains the code and documentation for a line-following car project using an STM32 microcontroller. The project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of embedded systems in robotics applications.

## Project Overview

The STM32 Line Following Car is a robotic vehicle that autonomously follows a line on the ground. It uses sensors to detect the line and adjusts its steering to stay on course. This project is ideal for learning about embedded systems, sensor integration, and control algorithms.

## Features

- **Line Detection**: Utilizes infrared sensors to detect the line.
- **Control Algorithm**: Implements a PID controller for smooth line following.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to modify and extend for additional features.
- **Real-time Processing**: Leverages the STM32's processing power for real-time decision making.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32 Microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103)
- Infrared Sensors
- Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)
- DC Motors
- Chassis for the car
- Power Supply

## Software Requirements

- STM32CubeIDE or any compatible IDE
- STM32 HAL Library
- C/C++ Compiler
